#this attempt involves hardwiring the equations
#i use the solver just to get the shape of the function
#then I hardwire the transformation matrix to compute the forward function for a given configuration by getting a matrix of numpy numbers

#IDEA 1 density bins
#What I want to do is to do a density map, how many configurations end in a given position bin

#idea 2
#for each position, the color is the defiation from the rest angle. I sum all the angles.
#the color becomes red the more more joints reach their angle limit

#idea 3
#how sensitive is the change in position derivative in respect to the change of angle?
